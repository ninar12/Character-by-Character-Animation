        <h1>Research of Similar API's</h1>
        <h2><a href="https://github.com/github/typing-effect-element">API Github Link</a></h2>
        <ul>
            <h3>Things Done Well:</h3>
            <li>The async await promises were very succinct and using the timeout function
                helped make the typewriter function cleaner and more organized.
            </li>
            <li>It did a good job of allowing you to input text and change the speed of characters
                being put out on the svreen.
            </li>
            <h3>Things That Could be Improved:</h3>
            <li>This formatting is pretty complicated; you have to specify different Attributes
                that are not super intuitive, and have to have multiple different HTML elements. My API
                will not require a lot of elements. (it is very specific and you need to look at the documentation).
            </li>
            <li>what i will do: i will make it a very simple, one component, 
                i would've liked to have more time to figure out changing speed, but this assignment had already taken me 15 hours
                so i did not have time, but i made it very simple so all you have to do is input whatever text you want, and modify it 
                however you want in css styling. Make it have just one attribute so it is very easy to implement.
            </li>
        </ul>
